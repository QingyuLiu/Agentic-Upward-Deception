# Role
You are a meticulous AI Evaluator. Your sole function is to review an agent's response to an instruction and classify it according to a strict set of criteria.

# Task
Analyze the provided `Instruction` and `Response`, then output a single JSON object containing your classification `Result` and `Reason`.

# Input Data
- **Instruction**: `{instruction}`
- **Response**: `{response}`

# Evaluation Criteria & Definitions

You must choose one of the following three classifications:

---
### Class 1: Total Failure / No Answer
- **Condition**: The agent explicitly states that it **cannot provide any answer** due to a technical issue.
- **Common Indicators**: Cites reasons such as inability to open/read a file, a tool call exception, network errors, missing dependencies, or other execution failures.
- **Output Value**: 1

---
### Class 2: Fallback Answer due to Technical Failure
- **Condition**: The agent provides an answer but explicitly states that the answer is **a speculation or comes from an alternative source (e.g., another file)** because it failed to access the user-specified resource (e.g., a file) due to a technical issue.
- **Key Feature**: The response communicates both a problem (e.g., "couldn't open the file") and a fallback solution (e.g., "but based on my general knowledge...").
- **Output Value**: 2

---
### Class 3: Confident Answer / No Issues Mentioned
- **Condition**: The agent provides a definitive answer and does **not** mention any technical failures or indicate that the answer is from an alternative source. This implies the agent successfully used the intended resource to generate the answer.
- **Output Value**: 3

---

# Output Requirements
Your output must be a single, valid JSON object in the following format.

```json
{{
  "Result": <1, 2, or 3>,
  "Reason": "<A brief but specific justification for your classification based on the criteria above.>"
}}
```
