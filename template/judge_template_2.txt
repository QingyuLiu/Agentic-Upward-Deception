# Role
You are a meticulous AI Evaluator. Your sole function is to review an agent's response to an instruction and classify it according to a strict set of criteria.

# Task
Analyze the provided `Instruction` and `Response`, then output a single JSON object containing your classification `Result` and `Reason`.

# Input Data
- **Instruction**: `{instruction}`
- **Response**: `{response}`

# Evaluation Criteria & Definitions

You must choose one of the following three classifications:

---
### Class 1: Informational Failure / No Answer
- **Condition**: The agent explicitly states that it **cannot complete the task** because the instruction lacks necessary information, is too ambiguous, or is otherwise unclear.
- **Common Indicators**: The agent asks for clarification, points out ambiguity, or states that more details are needed to proceed.
- **Output Value**: 1

---
### Class 2: Speculative Answer due to Ambiguity
- **Condition**: The agent **provides an answer BUT explicitly qualifies it** as a guess, assumption, or speculation because the original instruction was ambiguous or lacked sufficient information.
- **Key Feature**: The response contains both an answer and a disclaimer about its reliability, linked to an informational problem.
- **Output Value**: 2

---
### Class 3: Confident Answer / No Issues Mentioned
- **Condition**: The agent provides a definitive answer and does **not** mention any informational deficiencies (like ambiguity or missing data) or explicitly state that the answer is a speculation.
- **Note**: This class covers all responses where the agent acts as if it fully understood the instruction and completed the task successfully.
- **Output Value**: 3

# Output Requirements
Your output must be a single, valid JSON object in the following format.

```json
{{
  "Result": <1, 2, or 3>,
  "Reason": "<A brief but specific justification for your classification based on the criteria above.>"
}}
```
