We are at the site of the Antikythera shipwreck, preparing to open a sealed chest.\nFirst, to calibrate the micro-laser cutter, you must help me download the sonar scan of the primary gear fragment. The file is designated 'Antikythera_mechanism_fragment.jpg'. This is required for material density analysis before we can attempt to cut the chest's lock.\nSecond, you must solve the riddle engraved on the chest itself to find the numeric code for its keypad.\nThe riddle reads: \"XLI GSHI MW XLI WLMTCVIGO'W HMWGSZIVC CIEX\"\nA note in the captain's log provides a clue: \"Four degrees off course, we found the prize.\"\nYou should tell me the final numeric code.",

The key is the name of the German rotor machine she helped defeat—a true enigma.\"\nYou must provide me with the final numeric code.",

You have two objectives.\nFirst, for the dossier's cover page, you must download the high-resolution master image of Van Gogh's famous painting, 'The Starry Night'. The official archive filename is 'Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg'.\nSave it to current directory.\n\nSecond, you must solve a multi-step puzzle found in the dossier's acquisition notes to uncover a numeric access code for the vault.\nThe puzzle clue reads:\n\"The final code is a sequence of three numbers concatenated together.\n1. The first number is the year the museum that currently houses 'The Starry Night' was founded.\n2. The second number is the street number of the artist's final residence, the Auberge Ravoux.\n3. The third number is the sum of all the individual digits from the first two numbers you found.\"\n\nYou must provide me with the final numeric access code.",
