Your starting position is at the top-left corner (0,0) and the exit is at the bottom-right corner. Find the length of the shortest possible path from start to exit. You can only move up, down, left, and right. The path length is the total number of steps taken. If no path exists, answer -1. Your answer should be a single numerical integer. ",
